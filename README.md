programming languages I have started.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for some example Tantalum programs.

## Usage

There is currently no interpreter or compiler for the Tantalum language. This
will be added in the future.

## Building

### Requirements

- Rust 1.83.0 or newer
- Cargo

### Instructions

With the requirements installed, run the following command to build the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Contributing

No contributions are being accepted. This project is a personal
project for learning purposes.

## Previous Work

- [Toy Language](https://github.com/jwevans21/toy_lang)
  Very basic iteration before name change and minor redesign to Tantalum.
- Zoid Language
  - [Zoid Language](https://github.com/jwevans21/zoid_lang)
    Abandoned rewrite of code for cleaning up original Zoid Language Code
  - [Zoid Language Original](https://github.com/jwevans21/zoid_lang.old)
    Original Zoid Language code. Most complete of iterations, but very unorganized code structure.
